## Life


I UPDATE missed being born in North Carolina, where most of my family lives, and instead grew up in Atlanta with a sister named [Rachel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2717269). After a lifetime as an overprivileged and under-aware prep star at Pace Academy, I went to Vanderbilt University, where I did Economics, Chinese, Frisbee, and other general shenanigans. For a semester, I lived in Beijing. After school, I moved to New York to take my first job at Yelp. Later I moved to Phoenix, still with Yelp. Then back to NYC for a new job and with my girlfriend [Janice](https://www.facebook.com/janice.bacuetes) (*juh-neece*), with whom I now reside contentedly in South Williamsburg, on the East River.

## Pictures

UPDATE I go places and take photos. When that happens, I usually put the photos [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/1/photos/101682164582576787375/albums/6183474494321744017?authkey=CPS4p9bfu_7v1QE), of all places. Here's a taste:

## This Site

I thought a personal website could be an interesting side project. But, I didn't have any web experience so I "had some help" from from my [SeatGeek boss](https://seatgeek.com/sgteam/#BenClark)

 Here are some of the things that I used:

* [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/about/) for domain registration
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for simple, free web hosting
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for easy templating and markdown things
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) and [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) themes from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) for "visually enhancing my personal brand"
* [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) for the slideshow up there
