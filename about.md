## Life


After moving 5 times as a child, I now call Kansas City home ( though none of the 4 older siblings do). During those formative years, I went to an all-male Jesuit high school,  worked at a local carwash then started a car detailing company, and occasionally explored nearby farms. I decided I wanted a bit of a change so I went far far away to the University of Michigan where I am currently a senior studying business and informatics. I am seeking a data analyst position within the technology sector upon graduation.

## This Site

I thought a personal website could be an interesting side project. But, I didn't have any web experience so I "had some help" from my [SeatGeek boss](https://seatgeek.com/sgteam/#BenClark)

 Here are some of the things that I used:

* [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/about/) for domain registration
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for simple, free web hosting
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for easy templating and markdown things
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) and [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) themes from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) for "visually enhancing my personal brand"
* [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) for the slideshow up there
* [Fitbit](https://dev.fitbit.com), [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), [Uber](https://developer.uber.com), & [Starbucks](https://testhost.openapi.starbucks.com/location/v2/#Earth) APIs for Quantified Tom
* [Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/) for tracking hits and clicked links
