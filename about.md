I recently heard [Harper Reed](http://harperreed.com/#/) speak at [Think Chicago](http://www.thinkchicago.net). I thought the idea was awesome so I copied it. This feed automatically updates.

## Life


I UPDATE missed being born in North Carolina, where most of my family lives, and instead grew up in Atlanta with a sister named [Rachel](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=2717269). After a lifetime as an overprivileged and under-aware prep star at Pace Academy, I went to Vanderbilt University, where I did Economics, Chinese, Frisbee, and other general shenanigans. For a semester, I lived in Beijing. After school, I moved to New York to take my first job at Yelp. Later I moved to Phoenix, still with Yelp. Then back to NYC for a new job and with my girlfriend [Janice](https://www.facebook.com/janice.bacuetes) (*juh-neece*), with whom I now reside contentedly in South Williamsburg, on the East River.

## Pictures

I mainly travel with my family. Luckily, my sister [Mary](https://www.facebook.com/mary.zidar?fref=ts) loves to capture the moment.

Here's a taste:

## This Site

I thought a personal website could be an interesting side project. But, I didn't have any web experience so I "had some help" from my [SeatGeek boss](https://seatgeek.com/sgteam/#BenClark)

 Here are some of the things that I used:

* [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/about/) for domain registration
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for simple, free web hosting
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) for easy templating and markdown things
* [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) and [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) themes from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) for "visually enhancing my personal brand"
* [Blueimp Gallery](https://github.com/blueimp/Gallery) for the slideshow up there
* [Fitbit](https://dev.fitbit.com), [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/), [Uber](https://developer.uber.com), & [Starbucks](https://testhost.openapi.starbucks.com/location/v2/#Earth) APIs for Quantified Tom
